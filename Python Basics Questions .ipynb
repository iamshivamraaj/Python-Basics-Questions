What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n"," - Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its simple syntax and readability. It's popular because it's easy to learn, supports multiple programming paradigms, has extensive libraries and frameworks, and is widely used in areas like web development, data science, and AI."],"metadata":{"id":"dQ0uyLwD2er3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   - A Python interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions for direct execution. In short, the Python interpreter acts as a bridge between human-readable Python code and machine-executable instructions."],"metadata":{"id":"zAmxWTUm2u3v"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes in the Python programming language. They cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers."],"metadata":{"id":"y5VYz4jS5HRF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words with specific meanings and functions in the Python language, and using them as variable names would cause a syntax error."],"metadata":{"id":"jT1a58RK6Mgj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What is mutability in Python?\n","  - Mutability in Python refers to an object’s ability to change its state or contents after it has been created.\n","\n","Mutable Objects: Can be modified after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets).\n","Immutable Objects: Cannot be modified after creation (e.g., strings, tuples, integers)."],"metadata":{"id":"jYuNGzfE6iee"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  - Lists are mutable because they are designed for flexibility. They are intended to hold collections of data that may need to change over time (e.g., adding, removing, or modifying elements). This allows for efficient updates and dynamic changes to the data.\n","\n","  - Tuples are immutable because they are designed for fixed collections of data. Once created, the data in a tuple cannot be modified. This provides benefits like data integrity, performance optimization, and the ability to use tuples as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets (since they are hashable). The immutability ensures that the data remains constant and safe from accidental changes."],"metadata":{"id":"dWPUD86q7ZI2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7.  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","  - The difference between the == and is operators in Python is:\n","\n","  - == (Equality Operator): Compares the values of two objects to check if they are equal. It checks whether the contents of the objects are the same, regardless of whether they are stored in the same location in memory.\n","\n","  - is (Identity Operator): Compares the identities of two objects to check if they are the same object in memory. It checks whether both variables refer to the exact same object in memory, not just objects with the same value."],"metadata":{"id":"XvjbO_d58MBE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","  - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return Boolean results (True or False). They allow you to perform logical operations on expressions."],"metadata":{"id":"0zhUtzqp88D_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. What is type casting in Python?\n","  - Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. Python provides functions to explicitly cast or convert one type to another. This is useful when you need to perform operations on data that requires a specific type."],"metadata":{"id":"gMO7IxKf9T-u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  - Implicit Type Casting:\n","Implicit type casting, also known as automatic type conversion, is when the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type into another without requiring explicit instructions from the programmer. It usually happens when performing operations between different data types where one type can be safely converted into another.\n","\n","  - Explicit Type Casting:\n","Explicit type casting, also known as manual type conversion, is when the programmer explicitly converts one data type into another using built-in Python functions such as int(), float(), str(), or bool(). This is done when the programmer wants precise control over the type conversion process."],"metadata":{"id":"j84owoIX9xpd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","  - Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow the program to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are met."],"metadata":{"id":"vDc8hn0BokVA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. How does the elif statement work?\n","  - The elif (short for \"else if\") statement is used to check multiple conditions sequentially after an initial if condition fails. It allows you to test multiple expressions and execute the block of code associated with the first condition that evaluates to True."],"metadata":{"id":"jPDJIiOspGOO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  - for Loop:\n","A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence. It is primarily used when the number of iterations is known in advance.\n","\n","  - while Loop:\n","A while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition evaluates to True. It is primarily used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition being met"],"metadata":{"id":"T6KuRTSvpd63"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","  - Scenario Where a while Loop is More Suitable Than a for Loop\n","Scenario: User Login System with Limited Attempts\n","\n","Imagine you're building a user login system where the user has 3 attempts to enter the correct password. You don't know in advance how many attempts the user will need (it could be 1, 2, or 3), so a while loop is more appropriate because it depends on a condition rather than a fixed number of iterations."],"metadata":{"id":"yH8PpHeAqLC9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Practical** **Questions**"],"metadata":{"id":"LTMB5ncYqzkr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
